About two-thirds of these are things I've used, but quite a few were taken from a helpful [astrobites article](https://astrobites.org/guides/guide-to-astrophysical-software/). Plagiarism is the sincerest form of flattery.


### ds9

SAO ds9 is an astronomical image viewer and manipulator.

## GAIA

The Graphical Astronomy and Image Analysis Tool. It is a derivative of the [Skycat](https://www.eso.org/sci/observing/tools/skycat.html) catalog and is distributed as part of the [Starlink](http://starlink.eao.hawaii.edu/starlink/WelcomePage) package.

### SExtractor

Source Extractor, a program that operates on a FITS image to automatically detect objects.  Once sources have been identified, a variety of measurements are made including source size, shape and magnitude.  

Links: [website](http://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor), PDF guide, [SExtractor for Dummies](http://astroa.physics.metu.edu.tr/MANUALS/sextractor/Guide2source_extractor.pdf).

A pdf manual is available here (for a slightly older version of the code).  SExtractor for Dummies is another manual, though untested by this author.**

### Sherpa and other CIAO software

CIAO is the software suite developed by the Chandra X-Ray Center for analysing data from the Chandra X-ray Telescope. It can also be used with data from other Astronomical observatories, whether ground or space based.

Sherpa performs forward fitting of models to data in N dimensions, and is a central part of CIAO: [website](http://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/sherpa/)

ds9 is used for visualization.

### TOPCAT 

*A program to interactively view tabular data of astronomical data sets. Check out their screenshots page to see some neat examples of what it can do.*
