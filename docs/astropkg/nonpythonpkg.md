### Julia Astro

[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is easy to program, runs fast, and pretty much everything needed for modern scientific programming is built in as standard. And it even uses unicode variable names, for those who think $$\pi$$ is more readable than `np.pi` (it is!).

For astronomers, Julia Astro is working towards doing much of what AstroPy can do:

- Website: [juliaastro.github.io/](https://juliaastro.github.io/)
- GitHub: [https://github.com/JuliaAstro](https://github.com/JuliaAstro)

Good software, bad timing (unfortunately), just as most professional astronomers have converged on Python as their common language.

### IDL

Departing from the open source theme, this is the exact opposite: expensive, proprietary, tightly controlled. I haven't used it and probably never will, but some (many?) professional astronomers clearly still regard it as essential to their work. 

- Website: [harrisgeospatial.com/Software-Technology/IDL](https://www.harrisgeospatial.com/Software-Technology/IDL)
- GitHub: *you must be joking!*

### GDL

The GNU Data Language aims for full compatibility with IDL but under a GPL (aggressively open-source) license.  I found it easy to install on Linux Mint but haven't used it enough for an informed opinion.

- GitHub: [//github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl](https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl)
- Docs, tutorials, etc: they refer you to the IDL resources

### IRAF

*IRAF Image Reduction and Analysis Facility is used for a wide range of tasks pertaining to optical and infrared data processing. STScI has released pyRAF, which allows Python scripting of IRAF tasks, a great advantage when trying to batch process data!*
